# PeakFlip
Reducing electricity costs using an IoT system

## Background:
Spot pricing became common with liberalising the electricity market
Prices change frequently during the day
With the widespread usage of renewable energy in the generation side made the market volatile
When the sun shines the supply of electricity increases
A supply-demand mismatch happens and the price decreases
In the evening the demand increases but the supply decreases
Which skyrocket the electricity price
By purchasing the electricity during an off-peak the electricity bill can be reduced significantly
